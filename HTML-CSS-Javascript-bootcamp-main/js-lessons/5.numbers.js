// Basic Arithmetic Operations

// ➕ Example 1: Addition
let sum = 5 + 3;
console.log("Sum:", sum);

// ➖ Example 2: Subtraction
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log("Difference:", difference);

// ✖️ Example 3: Multiplication
let product = 6 * 7;
console.log("Product:", product);

// ➗ Example 4: Division
let quotient = 20 / 5;
console.log("Quotient:", quotient);

// Exponents and Modulus

// 🎲 Example 5: Exponentiation
let square = 5 ** 2;
console.log("Square of 5:", square);

// 🎱 Example 6: Modulus (Remainder)
let remainder = 10 % 3;
console.log("Remainder of 10 divided by 3:", remainder);

// Increment and Decrement

// ⏫ Example 7: Increment
let count = 0;
count++;
console.log("Incremented count:", count);

// ⏬ Example 8: Decrement
let total = 100;
total--;
console.log("Decremented total:", total);
