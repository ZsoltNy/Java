// Basic Arithmetic Operations

// ➕ Example 1: Addition
let sum = 5 + 3;
console.log("Sum:", sum);

// ➖ Example 2: Subtraction
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log("Difference:", difference);

// ✖️ Example 3: Multiplication
let product = 6 * 7;
console.log("Product:", product);

// ➗ Example 4: Division
let quotient = 20 / 5;
console.log("Quotient:", quotient);

// Exponents and Modulus

// 🎲 Example 5: Exponentiation
let square = 5 ** 2;
console.log("Square of 5:", square);

// 🎱 Example 6: Modulus (Remainder)
let remainder = 10 % 3;
console.log("Remainder of 10 divided by 3:", remainder);

// Increment and Decrement

// ⏫ Example 7: Increment
let count = 0;
count++;
console.log("Incremented count:", count);

// ⏬ Example 8: Decrement
let total = 100;
total--;
console.log("Decremented total:", total);

// 🌟 Calculate the area of a rectangle with a width of 7 and a height of 4.
let rectangleWidth = 7;
let rectangleHeight = 4;
let rectangleArea = rectangleWidth * rectangleHeight;

// 🏀 Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10.
let circleRadius = 10;
let circleCircumference = 2 * Math.PI * circleRadius;

// 🎉 Increment the variable "partyGuests" by 5.
let partyGuests = 10; // Assuming initial value
partyGuests += 5;

// 📉 Decrement the variable "stockQuantity" by 1.
let stockQuantity = 20; // Assuming initial value
stockQuantity--;

// 🍎 Calculate the total cost for buying 3 apples at $1.50 each.
let applePrice = 1.5;
let appleQuantity = 3;
let totalCost = applePrice * appleQuantity;

// 🚀 Calculate the average speed of a car that travels 240 miles in 4 hours.
let distanceTraveled = 240; // miles
let timeTaken = 4; // hours
let averageSpeed = distanceTraveled / timeTaken;

// 💸 Calculate the remaining balance after spending $200 from an initial balance of $1000.
let initialBalance = 1000;
let spentAmount = 200;
let remainingBalance = initialBalance - spentAmount;

// 🕒 Increment the variable "hoursWorked" by 0.5.
let hoursWorked = 8; // Assuming initial value
hoursWorked += 0.5;
