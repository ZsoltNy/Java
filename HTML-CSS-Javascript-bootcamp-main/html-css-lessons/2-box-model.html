    <h1>Box Model Example</h1>
    <div class="box">This is a box element with padding, border, and margin.</div>
    <p>The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS, defining every HTML element as 
        a box comprising four main parts: content, padding, border, and margin. It 
        allows easy adjustment of element sizes, internal spacing, and positioning, 
        crucial for designing and styling web layouts. By using CSS styles, we can
         manipulate attributes like padding, margin, and border, effectively controlling
          the appearance and arrangement of elements on webpages.
